# Instructions

Hey! This repository should help you find your way around some software engineering tools.

Just open up the file named after the tool you're trying to understand :)

## Contributing

If you want to add some more instructions, you're most welcome to make a PR! I'm pretty opinionated, though:

- short is better than detailed
- be friendly, not just informative
- not too much jargon please
